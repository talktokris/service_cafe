## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive OTP (One-Time Password) orders management system with date filtering functionality as requested. The system allows head office and branch office users to view and manage orders that require OTP authentication.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes

-   **Migration**: Added OTP-related fields to the orders table

    -   `otp_phone` (phone number for OTP)
    -   `otp_email` (email address for OTP)

-   **Model Update**: Updated Order model to include OTP fields in fillable array and casts

### 2. Backend Controller

-   **OtpOrderController**: New controller with comprehensive functionality
    -   `index()`: Display OTP orders with date filtering and search
    -   `sendOtp()`: Send OTP to phone/email for an order
    -   `verifyOtp()`: Verify OTP code for an order
    -   Date filtering: Today and 7 days options
    -   Search by Order ID, OTP code, phone, email, or member details
    -   Permission-based access control for head office and branch office users

### 3. Frontend Implementation

    -   Modern UI with proper styling and animations

### 4. Navigation Integration

-   **Admin Sidebar**: Added "OTP Orders" menu item with lock icon
-   **Routes**: Added proper routes for OTP orders functionality
    -   `/otp-orders` - Main OTP orders page
    -   `/otp-orders/{orderId}/send-otp` - Send OTP API
    -   `/otp-orders/{orderId}/verify-otp` - Verify OTP API

### 5. Date Filtering System

-   **Today Filter**: Shows orders created today only
-   **7 Days Filter**: Shows orders from the last 7 days
-   **Tab Interface**: Easy switching between date ranges
-   **Real-time Updates**: Filters update page content immediately

### 6. Search Functionality

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

1. `database/migrations/2025_10_03_000000_add_otp_fields_to_orders_table.php`
2. `app/Http/Controllers/OtpOrderController.php`
3. `resources/js/Pages/HeadOffice/Super/OtpOrders.jsx`
4. `OTP_ORDERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

### Modified Files:

1. `app/Models/Order.php` - Added OTP fields to fillable and casts
2. `routes/web.php` - Added OTP orders routes and controller import
3. `resources/js/Pages/HeadOffice/AdminComponents/AdminSidebar.jsx` - Added navigation link

## Usage

### Access the Feature:

1. Log in as head office or branch office user
2. Navigate to "OTP Orders" in the sidebar
3. Use date filter tabs to switch between "Today" and "7 Days"
4. Search using the search box for specific orders
5. View order details, OTP status, and customer information

### OTP Workflow:

1. Orders can be marked with OTP requirement
2. OTP codes are generated and tracked
3. Status progression: Not Required → Sent → Verified/Expired
4. Phone and email tracking for OTP delivery

## Technical Implementation Details

### Date Filtering Logic:

-   **Today**: `whereDate('created_at', Carbon::today())`
-   **7 Days**: `whereBetween('created_at', [Carbon::now()->subDays(7)->startOfDay(), Carbon::now()->endOfDay()])`

### Search Implementation:

-   Multi-field search across order ID, OTP code, contact details, and member information
-   Optimized queries with proper indexing support

### UI/UX Features:

-   Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
-   Loading states and proper error handling
-   Statistics overview for quick insights
-   Professional color scheme matching existing design

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

5. **Export Functionality**: Export OTP orders to CSV/PDF
6. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more filter options (status, amount range, etc.)
